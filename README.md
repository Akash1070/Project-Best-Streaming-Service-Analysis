# Project-Best-Streaming-Service-Analysis
There is a lot of competition between all the major streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. 
As a Data Scientist, it could be a very amazing task for you to find which is the best streaming service among them. 
In this project, Iâ€™m going to introduce you to a data science project on the best streaming service analysis with Python.

For analyzing which is the best streaming service, I will be using the ratings of shows on all the major platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+.

The dataset that I will use for the task of Best Streaming service analysis contains a comprehensive list of all the TV shows which are available on the 4 platforms that we are comparing in this task.

-Analyzing the streaming platforms
-Analyzing the IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes ratings of all the shows
-Analyzing the target age group of most of the TV shows.
-What Are The Top Movies On Each Platform
-Exploring Genres
