# **Best Streaming Service Analysis**

There is a lot of competition between all the major streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. As a Data Scientist, it could be a very amazing task for you to find which is the best streaming service among them. In this project, I’m going to introduce you to a data science project on the best streaming service analysis with Python.

For analyzing which is the best streaming service, I will be using the ratings of shows on all the major platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+.

The dataset that I will use for the task of Best Streaming service analysis contains a comprehensive list of all the TV shows which are available on the 4 platforms that we are comparing in this task..

**To Determine following data from the dataset using Python:**

1. Analyzing the streaming platform

2. Analyzing the IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes ratings of all the shows

3. Analyzing the target age group of most of the TV shows.

4. What Are The Top Movies On Each Platform

5. Exploring Genres
